## Overview

BingeBox is a comprehensive movie and TV show management system designed to address the challenges of content discovery, personalization, and administrative control in the modern streaming landscape. In an era where users are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content distributed across multiple streaming platforms, BingeBox offers a unified solution that aggregates metadata, streaming availability, and user engagement features within a single, database-driven framework. The system enables users to efficiently search for movies and TV shows, curate personalized watchlists, track search history, and contribute reviews and ratings, thereby fostering an interactive and community-driven environment. Administrators benefit from robust tools for content management, user moderation, and analytics, ensuring data integrity and platform quality. 

The platform leverages secure authentication protocols, role-based access control (RBAC), and integration with external APIs to provide real-time streaming availability and maintain high standards of data privacy and security. The underlying relational database is normalized to the third normal form (3NF), supporting scalability, consistency, and efficient query performance. BingeBox’s modular architecture is built using industry-standard technologies such as MySQL, React.js, and adheres to best practices in RESTful API design and web application security.
